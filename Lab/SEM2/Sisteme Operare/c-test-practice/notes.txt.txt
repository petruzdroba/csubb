Finding an manual entry with:
	-man command
For multimple commands with the same name
	-Find all usages:
		--what is command // return options like command(n), n - the number in the manual
		-- man n command

To compile a program
	-gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g file.c/cpp
		--gcc compiler
		-- Warning All, Warning Error, Waring Extra
		--g, run globally

	- watch gcc gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g file.c/cpp
		--will update program if any cahnges made max 2 seconds

	-optional add -o file.out
		--specify where you want your out file to be compiled to
		--defaults to a.out
	-run an .out/.exe file with ./a.out and if any aguments if it has any

Valgrind
	-Compile program first
		--gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g file.c/cpp
	-Run out file with Valgrind
		-valgrind ./a.out
		
		--Not aloccated enough space
			---Invalid write size of {size:number} at adress {hexa adress}
			---means you wrote too much space in HEAP, shouldve allocated more space
		--Not freed up enough space
			---leak summary : definitely losts : {size: number} bytes in {int} blocks
			---check how much space you freed up, probably much less than you allocated

		--Invalid write/read of {size:number}
			---check fors for stopping too early/late

		--If memory cleared
			---no leaks are possible
	-Each time you run valgrind you have to recompile the .c file, or else changes wont be noticed, valgrind looks at the out file
